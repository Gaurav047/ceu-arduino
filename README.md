Céu-Arduino supports the development of Arduino applications in the programming
language Céu:

[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) Arduino is an open-source project that
created microcontroller-based kits for building digital devices and interactive
objects that can sense and control physical devices.

Céu is a reactive language that aims to offer a higher-level and safer
alternative to C:

- Home Page:   http://www.ceu-lang.org/
- Source code: https://github.com/ceu-lang/ceu/

Céu-Arduino empowers the development of Arduino applications with the following
extensions:

- Awaiting events in direct/sequential style.
  <!--(e.g., timers, pin changes, serial input, etc).-->
- Parallel lines of execution with
    - safe abortion;
    - deterministic behavior (in contrast with threads).
- Asynchronous loops for heavy computations.
- Interrupt-driven operation mode (optional and experimental).
- Seamless integration with standard Arduino (e.g., `analogRead`, `random`,
  etc).

Examples
========

The `examples/` directory contains a number of examples.

Blinking a LED
--------------

<!--

Observe the behavior of the program in the video on the right.
-->

The example `blink-01.ceu` assumes that a LED is connected to *pin 13*.

The program is an infinite `loop` that intercalates between turning the LED
*on* and *off* in intervals of 1 second:

```
#include "out.ceu"              // uses GPIO (OUT_13)
#include "wclock.ceu"           // uses timers (await 1s)

output high/low OUT_13;         // declares OUT_13 an output pin

loop do                         // runs an infinite loop that
    emit OUT_13(high);          //   - turns the LED on
    await 1s;                   //   - awaits 1 second
    emit OUT_13(low);           //   - turns the LED off
    await 1s;                   //   - awaits another 1 second
end                             //   - repeats
```

<!--
- Line 3 configures `PIN_13` as an output pin.
- Lines 6,8 alternate

Just like regular Arduino programming, a pin must be configured to work in
*input* or *output* mode.
Céu uses `input` and `output` events for this purpose.

In the example, the first line configures `PIN_13` as an output pin that accepts <tt>int</tt> values.

The program is a `loop` that sets `PIN_13` to `HIGH`, awaits 1 second, sets
`PIN_13` to `LOW`, awaits another second, and repeats the process over and over.
-->

Switching a LED
---------------

<!--
{{#ev:youtube|MvAtNfcNS58|300|right}}
-->

The example `button-01.ceu` requires a simple circuit with a switch button
connected to *pin 2*.

The program waits for changes on *pin 2* (the switch), copying its value to
*pin 13* (the LED):

```
#include "out.ceu"
#include "int0.ceu"                 // declares input `INT0` (UNO=D2, MEGA=D21)

output high/low OUT_13;

var high/low v = call INT0_Get();   // gets current value of the pin
emit OUT_13(v);                     // sets the LED to this value

loop do
    await INT0;                     // waits for a pin change event
    v = call INT0_Get();            // gets the new state of the pin
    emit OUT_13(v);                 // sets the LED to this value
end

```

<!--
Céu can directly use standard Arduino functionality by prefixing its symbols
with an underscore (e.g., `_digitalRead(2)`).

Now, we also use an input event to read <tt>int</tt> values from <tt>PIN2</tt>.
Whenever its value changes, the command <tt>await PIN02</tt> resumes and sets
<tt>v</tt>, which is copied to <tt>PIN13</tt>.
-->

Blinking in Parallel
--------------------

<!--
{{#ev:youtube|6ZsF6X1wn84|300|right}}
-->

The example `blink-02.ceu` requires two additional LEDs connected to
*pins 11 and 12*.

The program blinks the LEDs with different frequencies, in parallel:

```
#include "out.ceu"
#include "wclock.ceu"

output high/low OUT_11;
output high/low OUT_12;
output high/low OUT_13;

par do
    loop do
        emit OUT_11(high);
        await 1s;
        emit OUT_11(low);
        await 1s;
    end
with
    loop do
        emit OUT_12(high);
        await 500ms;
        emit OUT_12(low);
        await 500ms;
    end
with
    loop do
        emit OUT_13(high);
        await 250ms;
        emit OUT_13(low);
        await 250ms;
    end
end
```

<!--
The <tt>par</tt> statement of Céu allows that multiple lines of execution run
concurrently in the same program.
-->

Fading a LED
------------

The example `pwm-01.ceu` assumes that an LED is connected to *pin 06*.

The program fades the LED from `0` to `255` and from `255` to `0` in two
consecutive loops:

```
#include "pwm.ceu"
#include "wclock.ceu"

loop do
    var int i;
    loop i in [0->255] do
        spawn Pwm(6, i);
        await 5ms;
    end
    loop i in [0<-255] do
        spawn Pwm(6, i);
        await 5ms;
    end
end
```

Serial Echo
-----------

The example `usart-01.ceu` reads and write strings from and to the serial in a
continuous loop:

```
#include "usart.ceu"

spawn USART_Init(9600);

loop do
    var[20] byte str = [];
    await USART_Rx(&str, _);
    await USART_Tx(&str);
end
```
